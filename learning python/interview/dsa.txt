TIME COMPLEXITY ?
>Most of the algorithms take more time to run for larger inputs.
>Time complexcity depemends on input size 'n'.
>Basic operation executes maximum number of times.we calculate the the time complexity by basic operation. we determine hom many times does basic operation
executes and is our time complexity.
