Binary search tree has some specification on which we call them as a binary search tree
The specifications are 
1: Each node will have two child nodes at most.
2: Each node will have two child nodes and the node which is on left should be less the parent node and
the node on right hand should be greater than parent node.
Example:
                       10
                     /    \
                     0    12  
                    / \   / \
                   -1  5 11 20 
                            / \
                           17 99

as you notice each node has eighter two nodes at most.Also all nodes which are in left hand side are less than parent node 
and all nodes which are in right hand are greater than parent node. 

Common question>>>>>>>
For binary search tree the common question in interview is add the given node in the given binary search tree.
>Let's just take the exmple to understand this. consider we have the above tree and given binary search tree
and we have to add -21 in the tree. 
>First we go to root node and check whereter the given input is less than left node or greter than right node.
if the given input is less than left node we go to left hand side of tree or if our given input in greater than 
right node than we go to right hand side of our tree. In our case -21 is less than left node which is zero so 
we go to the left hand side.
>Now we do the same compare our input with left and right nodes. again our inpu -21 in less than left node which 
is -1. so we go to the -1 node. 
>since -1 node has to parent node and -21 is less than -1 we place our -21 node at left side of -1 node.

output:
                       10
                     /    \
                     0    12  
                    / \   / \
                   -1  5 11 20 
                   /        / \
                  -21      17 99


Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree?
>Binary tree is also a valid term in Computer science but the difference between two is binary tree has two
childerens at most but there is no condition such a left node will be less than parent node and right node will be 
greater than parent node. In Binary tree if each node has two nodes at most it is called binary tree.
